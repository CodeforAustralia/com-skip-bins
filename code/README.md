# Ruby on Rails - MongoId(ODM)

## Background

Aiming to develop as fast as we can under a open source license , we choosed Ruby on Rails as a base technology/Framework.

## Technical information

This is  the seed project to start working with Ruby on Rails but not using the traditional Active Record (M(Model) layer in a traditional MVC project).We found MongoId that is officially  (Object Document Mapper) supported by MongoDB and allow the model layer to be more flexible and on the other hand enhance the capability to use a Non Relational database (one of our goals).
