# Ruby on Rails - MongoId(ODM)

## Background

Aiming to develop as faster as we can under a Open Source license, we select Ruby on Rails as a base technology.

## Technical information

This is  the seed project to start working with Ruby on Rails but not using the traditional Active Record (Model layer in a traditional MVC).We found MongoId that is officially supported by Mongo and allow the Model layer to be more flexible.
